# FCP

FCP (Face Cloaking Project) is a Python-based framework for building and running a face obfuscation web platform.

## Installation

The project is written with Python 3.8 and was tested using this version. It is likely that any Python version from 3.6 and after will work as well, though different packages versions might be in need.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or any other package manager to install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Usage

This is a pilot version, intended for the exclusive use of Tel Aviv University Computer Science department personnel only.

This is due to the fact that it uses TAU servers in order to run the Face-Off algorithm, for which a user & password are required.


```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
